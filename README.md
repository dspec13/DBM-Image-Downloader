# DBM-Image-Downloader
This is a short python 3 script to download all of the pages of [Dragon Ball Multiverse](https://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/) (as of 4th of May 2024)
This is mainly intended to gather the pages of the webcomic for offline viewing on e-readers.

## If You Are Reading This In The Future...
... I am probably dead (Just Kidding!). But I'm only likely to update this script VERY infrequently, as I tend to read DBM only once a year or two, just to give me a large ammount of content to consume at once. As the script currently stands it is fully functional up to Page 2334. If more pages have been published since the time I wrote this and now, just open the Downloader script with any text editor & change the value of the variable _currentNumberOfPagesPublished_ to the current number of pages published. Enjoy Reading!

## Notes & Instructions
<ul>
<li>Be sure that you have proper Write Permissions for the directory you run Downloader.py in</li>
<li>When you run this script, a new directory "Dragon Ball Multiverse" will be created. All of the pages will be downloaded into this directory</li>
<li>Once the download is complete, you just need to process them into a e-reader viewable package with the utility of your choice.</li>
</ul>

#### Disclaimer
I have no association with the authors of Dragon Ball Multiverse, nor the creators of Kindle Comic Converter and Calibre. Additionally, Dragonball, DragonBall Z, DragonBall GT, and DragonBall Super are all owned by Funimation, Toei Animation, Shueisha, and Akira Toriyama. I __HIGHLY__ recommend that you support the official release.

Yes, I shamelessly borrowed the 2nd half of the disclaimer from Team Four Star (of whom I also hold no affiliation). If you haven't heard of them & are a fan of all things DragonBall you'll definetely want to check out their [DBZ Abridged Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&t=1s).
